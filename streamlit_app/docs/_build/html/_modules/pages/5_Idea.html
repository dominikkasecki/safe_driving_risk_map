<span class="c1"># Clear problem statement, define project objectives, and propose feasible solutions that demonstrate</span>

<span class="c1"># Good: understanding business context in final presentation, communicate insights. </span>
<span class="c1"># engaging, well-structured, emphasizes practical implications within broader business context.</span>

<span class="s1">    Imagine you are driving down an urban road in Breda, just minding your own business. However,</span>
<span class="s1">             due to unforeseen circumstances, for example, overgrown bushes, sidestreets that are hidden</span>
<span class="s1">             from view or hard rain, you are unable to see the oncoming intersection.</span>
<span class="s1">             This could lead to a dangerous situation or potentially a traffic incident. Too many incidents</span>
<span class="s1">             happen on rural roads especially. Our client, ANWB, came to us with this rising issue and</span>
<span class="s1">             asked us what could be done about it.  </span>
<span class="s1">             Looking at the Netherlands overall, it is one of </span>
<span class="s1">             the best countries at enforcing safer traffic for everyone. Many programmes have been </span>
<span class="s1">             implemented over the years to improve traffic safety, all under the name Sustainable Safety</span>
<span class="s1">             (SWOV, 2018). Three principles were followed when implementing measures to improve road</span>
<span class="s1">             safety: eliminating, minimizing and mitigating. We decided to focus on mitigating effects</span>
<span class="s1">             with the data that was available to us. The mitigating principle holds in that &#39;where people</span>
<span class="s1">             are exposed to risks, their consequences should as far as possible be mitigated by taking </span>
<span class="s1">             appropriate mitigating measures&#39; (SWOV, 2018, p. 8). Thus, our project not only aligns</span>
<span class="s1">             well with the client&#39;s needs, but also on a national level.  </span>
<span class="s1">             The purpose of the project would be to mitigate risk on urban roads in Breda. It was </span>
<span class="s1">             noticed that tons of applications exist that show traffic information on a broad scale,</span>
<span class="s1">             not on a more local scale, like per street. Even if a street is not busy, it could still</span>
<span class="s1">             be potentially dangerous to drive through due to a myriad of factors. Our application takes</span>
<span class="s1">             into account these factors and labels streets in Breda as either low-risk or high-risk. </span>

<span class="s1">    Our project combines available datasets, including the ANWB safe driving dataset, KNMI weather datasets</span>
<span class="s1">             and BRON accident dataset to determine whether a street is high-risk or low-risk to drive</span>
<span class="s1">             through. With the help of this application, users (mostly drivers, but also other traffic</span>
<span class="s1">             users) will be more prepared. Users could check ahead of time what kind of streets they </span>
<span class="s1">             will be driving through and depending on that could decide to reroute or be more aware</span>
<span class="s1">             when driving through streets labelled high-risk. Users will be more alert and drive more safely</span>
<span class="s1">             when using this application, which will lead to less incidents.  </span>
<span class="s1">             This will also be beneficial</span>
<span class="s1">             for ANWB&#39;s stakeholders to lower the costs of insurance. It aligns well with one of ANWB&#39;s missions</span>
<span class="s1">             as stated on their website, which is to prevent rather than insure. ANWB can also use this </span>
<span class="s1">             application to identify high-risk streets and confront the municipality of Breda to implement</span>
<span class="s1">             more safety measures in those areas. </span>
